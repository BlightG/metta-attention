# Experiment

## Overview

This experiment module is an experiment made on top of ECAN system to showcase
the capabaility of the **ECAN**.

The experiment aims to replicate the work done on the paper [**Shifting and Drifting**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326576861_Shifting_and_drifting_attention_while_reading_A_case_study_of_nonlinear-dynamical_attention_allocation_in_the_OpenCog_cognitive_architecture).
As decribed in the paper the aim of the experiment is to make A simple 
experimental example of the general principle of the **ECAN** architecture is explored. 
The system processes a series of articles that shifts from one topic (insects)
to another (poisons), and using its nonlinear attention-allocation dynamics 
(based on the ECAN Economic Attention Networks framework) to spread attention
back and forth between the nodes and links within the Atomspace knowledge store
representing the words in the sentences , and other nodes and links containing
related knowledge.
